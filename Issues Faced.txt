One if the major challenges that I have faced while I am building this Blog project is that, I didn't knew I have to create 2 saperate javascript files one for client side and one for server side. As I was using Javascript for backend too, I thought maybe i should include the frontend js code in that too. But boy I was so wrong. So I have to create another index.js file now the issue was, where do I place the file in the directory? Because there is already index.js(serverside js) in the directory. After researching about it, I got to know that whenever we are creating any kind of website, we are supposed to create 2 directories one is client and the other is server. That was new to me as I did not knew it. So I created 2 directories as said and placed all the server related files in server directory (Even css files should be placed in server directory because they are in public folder) and in client directory I placed only one index.js file that looks after the behaviour of the website.

Now that I did it, the question arises is that, how can i include it in the website. Obliously, I had to include this line of code "<script src="../../client/index.js"></script>" in the index.ejs file and wrote some alert code in index.js(clientside) file and was confident it would work. Boy was i wrong! I started getting no response from server. I couldnt figure why its not responding. I was scratching my head and even took 3 days off from doing the project. Finally after 3 days I sat on it again, determined to figure out the issue. So the issue was that the website is supposed to load the index.js(client) file as soon as it is launched. So now i have to include it in get route handeler. But it is not able to figure out the clientside js file path. They finally I figured out how to do it and the website started to access my index.js(client) file
